<h1 class='h1'>Module Installation</h1>

<p>To add a module, copy it into the "node_modules" subdirectory of your application project. After that, you can invoke it from your program with a <i>require()</i> call.</p>

<p>Most of these 3rd party modules are open source, and hosted on GitHub.com. From there you can download the source code with your web browser. Or use `git` to clone the code directly from the repository into your computer. Sounds simple enough, but what if there was an even easier way?</p>

<h2>Node Package Manager (npm)</h2>

<p>With the other installation methods, you need to first locate the web page of the module's project. Or find out what its git URI is. But with <b>npm</b> all you need to know is the module's name.</p>

<kbd>npm install <i>[module_name]</i></kbd>

<p>npm will automatically download and store the module's files in the <i>node_modules</i> subdirectory. And if the module itself has further dependencies of its own, npm will also fetch those. Some modules require code to be compiled. npm will take care of that too.</p>
